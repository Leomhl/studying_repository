# Anguar StarWars

This project was created to teach Angular to front-end students. 
Angular StarWars consume the https://swapi.dev/ and list person and planets of the StarWars universe. 
In this project I used routes, providers, views, components, services and others.

## Development server

Run `nmp i`, and then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
